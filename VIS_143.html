            <h1>VIS 143: Virtual Environments</h1>
            <p>My experience in Virtual Reality has so far been solely for entertainment. I've never owned my own, and have only used a friend's for playing video games.<br /> 
            These would range from sword fighting in Blade and Sorcery to meeting people in VR Chat. Both, while extremely different from one another, were extremely fun nonetheless. <br />
            From my limited experience with these games, I have decided that the most impressive component of Virtual Reality is the sense of community it establishes and nourishes. <br />
            It allows for people all over the world to seemingly exist within the same space to an uncanny degree and it also allows for people to support one another’s creations and passions <br /> 
            through individual expression and mod development. All of the experiences I have had with Virtual Reality have been pleasant; that would be except for the fact that I get a little motion sick <br />when wearing the headset for too long. <br />
            This is but a small price to pay when compared to all of the amazing limitations transcended with Virtual Reality. <br /> That being said, I am very eager to take a glimpse behind the mask to see exactly how these virtual worlds are created. <br />
            More specifically, I would love to be able to learn how to contribute to the mod development community that is ever growing in the gaming world. </p>
