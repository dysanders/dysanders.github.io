            <h1>VIS 160A: Senior Project TEST</h1>
            <p>
                I will document my progess and eventual finished product for my senior project, a game entirely developed by myself entitled <i>A Mixed Bag.</i> <br />
                It resembles an exploration and turn based RPG style approach to gameplay. The player will have to search for and utilize a myriad of varying items in different encounters in order to traverse through a new environment. <br />
                The catch, as the player will soon come to learn, is that each item does not behave as expected. A brief label or description will accompany each found object; however, upon use the collectible's action will instead depict a witty pun or play on words. <br />
                It can range from a literalist interpretation, a simple joke or an ironic homonym - anything to garner a chuckle from the player as they realize what the item's function actually is. <i>A Mixed Bag</i> will benefit from the player's previous experience from games as it will turn common video game and everyday items on their head in unexpected and pleasantly foolish ways.
